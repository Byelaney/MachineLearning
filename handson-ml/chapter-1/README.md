1. How would you define Machine Learning?
A: Machine Learning 关于构建可以从数据中学习的系统，学习意味着针对某个任务，和给定衡量性能的方法，能够在这个任务上做的越来越好。

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
A: 图像识别，语音识别，自然语言处理，启发人类学习。

3. What is a labeled training set?
A: 专门用于监督学习，也就是带有标记的数据。

4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
A: 分类(classification)和回归(regression)。

5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
A: 聚类(clustering)，可视化(visualization)，降维(dimensionality reduction)，关联规则学习(association rule learning)。

6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
A: 强化学习(reinforcement learning)。

7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
A: 如果你不知道分类的组，可以使用聚类(clustering)，如果你知道组可以用分类(classification)。

8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning algorithm?
A: 监督学习。

9. What is an online learning system?
A:

10. What is out-of-core learning?

11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?

12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm's hyper-parameter?

13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?

14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?

15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?

16. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?

17. What is the purpose of a validation set?

18. What can go wrong if you tune hyper-parameter using the test set?

19. What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?
